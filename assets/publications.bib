  abstract={The depth resolution of a continuous-wave time-of-flight (CW-ToF) imaging system is determined by its coding functions. Recently, there has been growing interest in the design of new high-performance CW-ToF coding functions. However, these functions are typically designed in a hardware agnostic manner, ie, without considering the practical device limitations, such as bandwidth, source power, digital (binary) function generation. Therefore, despite theoretical improvements, practical implementation of these functions remains a challenge. We present a constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions that adhere to hardware constraints. The optimization problem is non-convex with a large search space and no known globally optimal solutions. To make the problem tractable, we design an iterative, alternating least-squares algorithm, along with convex relaxation of the constraints. Using this approach, we design high-performance coding functions that can be implemented on existing hardware with minimal modifications. We demonstrate the performance benefits of the resulting functions via extensive simulations and a hardware prototype.}

  abstract={Permutation testing is a non-parametric method for obtaining the max null distribution used to compute corrected p-values that provide strong control of false positives. In neuroimaging, however, the computational burden of running such an algorithm can be significant. We find that by viewing the permutation testing procedure as the construction of a very large permutation testing matrix, , one can exploit structural properties derived from the data and the test statistics to reduce the runtime under certain conditions. In particular, we see that  is low-rank plus a low-variance residual. This makes  a good candidate for low-rank matrix completion, where only a very small number of entries of  ( of all entries in our experiments) have to be computed to obtain a good estimate. Based on this observation, we present RapidPT, an algorithm that efficiently recovers the max null distribution commonly obtained through regular permutation testing in voxel-wise analysis. We present an extensive validation on a synthetic dataset and four varying sized datasets against two baselines: Statistical NonParametric Mapping (SnPM13) and a standard permutation testing implementation (referred as NaivePT). We find that RapidPT achieves its best runtime performance on medium sized datasets (), with speedups of 1.5× - 38× (vs. SnPM13) and 20x-1000× (vs. NaivePT). For larger datasets () RapidPT outperforms NaivePT (6× - 200×) on all datasets, and provides large speedups over SnPM13 when more than 10000 permutations (2× - 15×) are needed. The implementation is a standalone toolbox and also integrated within SnPM13, able to leverage multi-core architectures when available.}

  abstract={This paper describes a web-enabled tool capable of generating high quality videos and images from multibody dynamics simulation results. This tool, called Chrono::Render, uses the Blender modeling software as the front end with Pixars RenderMan used to create high quality images. Blender is a free and open source tool used to create and visualize 3D content and provides a robust plugin framework which Chrono::Render leverages. To produce the final image, the Blender front end passes data to a RenderMan compliant rendering engine. Along with Pixars PhotoRealistic RenderMan (PRMan), several open source options such as Aqsis, JrMan, or Pixie can be used. Preprocessing is performed on the client side, where the front end generates a work order for the RenderMan compliant rendering engine to process. This work order, which contains several scripts that define the visualization parameters, along with the pre-processed simulation data and other user-defined geometry assets is uploaded to a remote server hosted by the Simulation Based Engineering Lab. This server contains more than a thousand CPU cores used for high performance computing applications, which can be used to render many frames of an animation in parallel. Chrono::Render is free and open source software released under a BSD3 license.}
