#   abstract={In accordance with some embodiments, systems, methods and media for encoding and decoding signals used in time-of-flight imaging are provided. In some embodiments, a method for estimating the depth of a scene is provided, comprising: causing a light source to emit modulated light toward the scene based on a modulation function; causing the image sensor to generate a first value based on the modulated light and a first demodulation function of K modulation functions; causing the image sensor to generate a second value; causing the image sensor to generate a third value; and determining a depth estimate for the portion of the scene based on the first value, the second value, the third value, and three correlation functions each including at least one half of a trapezoid wave.}
