title: "Metrics Database"
summary: "Metrics database and Web API for [Project Chrono](https://projectchrono.org/)"
abstract: "In this project we developed the full-stack of a web application that keeps track of the testing and performance metrics of Project Chrono. Every time a commit is made to the Chrono repository a set of unit tests and performance tests are ran on different machines. We extract metrics from these tests and save them in a database. The Project Chrono webpage can query the database through a RESTful API. You can see the [metrics history here](http://projectchrono.org/status/)."
