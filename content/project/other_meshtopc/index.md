title: "Mesh to Point Cloud Tool"
abstract: "We evaluated three different approaches to generate a dense point cloud from a 3D mesh. In particle-based fluid-solid interaction simulations it is desirable to have a dense point cloud representation of a 3D mesh. We find that a ray-crossing approach to detect if a particle is inside the mesh or not is a simple and effective way to generate the point clouds."
summary: "Convert a mesh to a point cloud."

We evaluated three different approaches to generate a dense point cloud from a 3D mesh. In particle-based fluid-solid interaction simulations it is desirable to have a dense point cloud representation of a 3D mesh. We find that a ray-crossing approach to detect if a particle is inside the mesh or not is a simple and effective way to generate the point clouds.
