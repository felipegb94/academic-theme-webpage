title: "Modular ToF Camera"
abstract: "The Lone Ranger is a modular continuous-wave time-of-flight camera for 3D sensing built from off the shelf parts. The main components are an arbitrary function generator, RF modulated laser, beam splitter, galvo mirrors, focusing lens, an APD, a frequency mixer, RF amplifiers, a low pass filter, and a data acquisition card. The triggers, controls, and data acquisition are fully automated with LabVIEW.

Additional description of the system is in section 8 of the supplement of the pdf."
