I am a 4th year Ph.D. student at UW-Madison advised by [Prof. Andreas Velten](https://biostat.wisc.edu/~compoptics/) and [Prof. Mohit Gupta](http://wisionlab.cs.wisc.edu/). My work is at the intersection of computer vision, signal processing, optics, and machine learning. My recent work has focused on practical modifications to time-of-flight imaging systems that allow them to operate robustly in everyday and adverse conditions. In general, I am interested in the theory, design, and applications of imaging systems. 

<!-- I am currently working on the design and implementation of new coding functions for time of flight imaging that reliably perform in low SNR scenarios. -->

<!-- In general, I am interested in both the theory of imaging systems and in the co-design of software and hardware required to implement such systems. My work and graduate studies have primarily focused on the fields of computational imaging/photography/optics, image processing, computer vision, and machine learning.

I did my undergraduate studies at UW-Madison where I graduated from the AMEP and Computer Sciences programs. During my undergraduate I worked with Prof. Vikas Singh on the statistical analysis of brain images, and with Prof. Dan Negrut on high performance computing applied to fluid simulations. -->
