  abstract={The depth resolution of a continuous-wave time-of-flight (CW-ToF) imaging system is determined by its coding functions. Recently, there has been growing interest in the design of new high-performance CW-ToF coding functions. However, these functions are typically designed in a hardware agnostic manner, ie, without considering the practical device limitations, such as bandwidth, source power, digital (binary) function generation. Therefore, despite theoretical improvements, practical implementation of these functions remains a challenge. We present a constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions that adhere to hardware constraints. The optimization problem is non-convex with a large search space and no known globally optimal solutions. To make the problem tractable, we design an iterative, alternating least-squares algorithm, along with convex relaxation of the constraints. Using this approach, we design high-performance coding functions that can be implemented on existing hardware with minimal modifications. We demonstrate the performance benefits of the resulting functions via extensive simulations and a hardware prototype.}

  abstract={This paper describes a web-enabled tool capable of generating high quality videos and images from multibody dynamics simulation results. This tool, called Chrono::Render, uses the Blender modeling software as the front end with Pixars RenderMan used to create high quality images. Blender is a free and open source tool used to create and visualize 3D content and provides a robust plugin framework which Chrono::Render leverages. To produce the final image, the Blender front end passes data to a RenderMan compliant rendering engine. Along with Pixars PhotoRealistic RenderMan (PRMan), several open source options such as Aqsis, JrMan, or Pixie can be used. Preprocessing is performed on the client side, where the front end generates a work order for the RenderMan compliant rendering engine to process. This work order, which contains several scripts that define the visualization parameters, along with the pre-processed simulation data and other user-defined geometry assets is uploaded to a remote server hosted by the Simulation Based Engineering Lab. This server contains more than a thousand CPU cores used for high performance computing applications, which can be used to render many frames of an animation in parallel. Chrono::Render is free and open source software released under a BSD3 license.}
